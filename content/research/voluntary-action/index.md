Some of our actions are responses to external events.
Other actions don't have immediate external triggers.
We call these *self-initiated* or *voluntary* actions.
In this project, working with Professor Patrick Haggard
and others at the UCL Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience,
I'm working on outlining how these self-initiated actions work.

The standard way to study self-initiated actions is to
ask participants to press a button "whenever they feel like it",
and record what happens in the brain in the seconds before they do so.
This has shown us that self-initiated actions depend on
neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex,
and in particular on the Supplementary Motor Area.
Using EEG, we can see that activity in this area
ramps up in the second or so prior to action,
producing a signal we call the *Readiness Potential* (RP),
pictured above.

We're interested in what this pre-movement activity actually does.
Originally people thought it was just motor preparation:
the work the brain needs to do in between deciding to move and actually moving.
However, if you ask people *when* they actually decided to move,
they report a time just before they actually did so,
well after the RP begins.
Some people think this means that the decision to move is made unconsciously
at the start of the RP, and we only become aware of it later.

The alternative is that the RP is actually
part of the decision-making process itself.
Our colleague Aaron Schurger suggested in 2012 that these kind of actions,
where participants are told to press a button whenever they feel like it,
might be triggered by random fluctuations in the brain reaching a threshold,
and that the RP just reflects this random activity rising towards threshold.
Others have argued that it reflects uncertainty or conflict in the decision to act,
or temporal expectations and predictions about when an action will occur.
In this project, we try to test these ideas.

To do this, we record EEG or fMRI while participants
perform self-initiated actions as part of realistic tasks.
This allows us to see how changes to the context in which
a person decides to initiate an action
affect the neural processes that make that action happen.

<!-- ## Decisions that Matter -->

<!-- One way we can do this is to come up with -->
<!-- more realistic tasks that require participants to make voluntary actions. -->

<!-- For example, in one experiment we devised a gambling task, -->
<!-- where participants were shown roulette-style wheels -->
<!-- and asked to press a button if they wanted to bet on them, or do nothing to pass. -->
<!-- We compared neural activity when participants pressed the button -->
<!-- to make a very good bet (action based on strong external evidence), -->
<!-- to make a 50:50 bet they were unsure about (conflicting external evidence), -->
<!-- or to make *mystery bets*, where they didn't know what they were betting on -->
<!-- (conflict, but no external evidence). -->
<!-- We found that RP-like EEG activity was strongest -->
<!-- when participants made the mystery bets, -->
<!-- indicating this activity depends on whether the decision to act -->
<!-- is based on external evidence or not, -->
<!-- and weaker for both good bets and 50:50 bets, -->
<!-- indicating the strength of the external evidence didn't matter. -->

<!-- In another experiment, we looked at how the size of the RP -->
<!-- is affected by participants' uncertainty about when they should act. -->
<!-- We designed a baking task, where they put a soufflé in the oven -->
<!-- at the start of each round, and had to wait a while before -->
<!-- pressing a button to take it out. -->
<!-- If they did so too soon, the soufflé would collapse and they would have to start again. -->
<!-- If they did so too late, they would waste time that could be spent on the next soufflé. -->
<!-- Over time, the learnt through experience how long they should wait before acting. -->
<!-- We found that the RP was bigger when participants knew how long to wait, -->
<!-- indicating that the RP is more to do with expectation and preparation -->
<!-- than than it is to do with uncertainty and randomness in action. -->
