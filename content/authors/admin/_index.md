I'm a cognitive neuroscientist
at the UCL
[Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/icn),
working in the [Neuroscience and Mental Health group](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/icn/research/research-groups/neuroscience-and-mental-health);

I'm currently looking for a position in data science/analysis in London.
I know lots of things about data, statistics, machine learning, Bayes, web development, Python, R, minds, and brains.
If you're looking for someone who knows these things, get in touch!
