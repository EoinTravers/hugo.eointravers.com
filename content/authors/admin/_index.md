I'm a cognitive scientist turned data scientist,
currently working on better ways to measure mental health and wellbeing
at [Unmind](https://unmind.com/).
I have a PhD in cognitive psychology
and did postdoctoral research in cognitive neuroscience (and a bit of philosophy.
**I'm interested in using data to understand people.**
