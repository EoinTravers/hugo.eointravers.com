It's always been useful to be able to run experiments online.
Post COVID-19, it's essential.
In this series of posts, I cover what you need to know
in order to move your research online.
The posts will be (roughly) as follows:

1. [How the Web Works](../web-1/)
2. **Choosing the Right Tools for the Job** [this post]
3. Doing Things the Hard Way [coming soon]
4. Setting the Scene: HTML and CSS [coming later]
5. Making it Move: JavaScript and jQuery [coming later]
6. Saving Data [coming later]
7. The Fancy Stuff: Animation, Canvas Rendering, Multimedia, and More [coming later]

# Part 2: Choosing the Right Tools for the Job

In [Part 1](,,/web-1/), I covered the basics of how the web works.
In this post, I survey some of the ways we can go about building online experiments.
This review should make it easier for you, the researcher,
do choose the tool that's right for you.

## Simplicity vs Flexibility

When choosing tools for any task,
we face a trade-off between simplicity and flexibility.
Some tools are simple to learn and use.
A screwdriver is the perfect, simple tool for driving in screws,
but isn't much use for anything else, like driving in nails.
A Leatherman multitool is pretty intimidating
when you fist pick it up,
and is a little more awkward to use than a screwdriver,
but it's a flexible, multi-purpose tool
that can be used to do more complicated work.

The same trade-off applies for software tools.
Some tools are simple,
and are ideal for the tasks they're designed for.
Microsoft Excel is a relatively simple tool for managing financial spreadsheets.
It's designed for this purpose,
and the decisions made by it's designers reflect this.
Excel is not designed to work with other kinds of data,
such as data from gene studies,
and so trying to use it for these purposes can have
[disastrous consequences](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/08/one-five-genetics-papers-contains-errors-thanks-microsoft-excel).
The same goes for MATLAB.
MATLAB is an excellent programming language for doing linear algebra,
the purpose for which it was designed.
However, this makes it extremely difficult to use MATLAB
to build user interfaces, or to build psychological experiments.

Other tools are flexible,
and can be used to solve many problems,
but they take longer to learn,
and are not so simple to use.
One such tools is the Python programming language.
Python is a general purpose programming language;
it can be used to process financial and genetic data,
linear algebra, video game design, running web servers,
and pretty much anything you might want to do with a computer.
The downside of this flexibility is that it's harder to learn
how to do simple accounting in Python than in, say, Excel.

## The Pareto Principle

Before moving on to experiment-building tools,
I want to talk briefly about the
[**Pareto Principle**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle),
also known as the **80:20 rule**.
In economics, this refers to the fact that
around 80% of wealth is held by
around 20% of the people,
while the remaining 80% of the people
have to share the remaining 20% of the wealth.
Similarly, in programming it's usually the case that
the first 80% of any project, including building an online experiment,
takes up 20% of your time,
while the last 20% of the project - the hard bits -
takes up 80% of your time.

This has important implications for the tools we should use.
Often, we end up choosing the simple tools that are best for
the initial, easy 80% of the project,
and then struggle with the tricky final 20%.
What we should do instead is choose the right tool
for the hard bits, that are going to take up most of our time,
even if this means it takes us a little longer to do the initial easy stuff.

With that out of the way, let's look at the tools available.
