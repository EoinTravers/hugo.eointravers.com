# Setting the Scene

To build a web page or an online experiment, we need to combine three languages: HTML, to create the contents and structure of our page, CSS, to control the appearance, and JavaScript, to make our page interactive by manipulating the HTML and CSS. In this post, I talk about how we can create and style the elements of our experiments using HTML and CSS. In the next post, we'll see how to modify them using JavaScript.

## Prerequisites

If you're not already familiar with HTML and CSS, please read MDN's [Getting started with HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Getting_started) tutorials (there's several pages), and then at least the first few pages of their [Learn CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS) guide. I'll briefly recap some ideas from those guides, but won't be going into enough detail if you're an absolute beginner. In other words, I'll assume you know the basics of how to use HTML and CSS to build a website, but not how to use them to build an experiment.

# Recap

## HTML

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is, at it's heart, a collection of tags that are used to build structured documents such as web pages.

![Anatomy of an HTML element, from MDN](https://media.prod.mdn.mozit.cloud/attachments/2014/11/14/9347/c07aa313dbdd667585430f4eca354dbd/grumpy-cat-small.png)

> ðŸ‘† Anatomy of an HTML element, from MDN's [Introduction to HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Getting_started)

There are [many](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element) different tags available, but we're only going to need a few of them for our purposes. Your entire page will be within a `<html>` tag (that is, between `<html>` and `</html>`). The header (metadata) of the page will be inside  a `<head>` tag. In it, we'll use `<link>` tags to load our CSS files, and  `<script>` tags to load our JavaScript. The body and contents of the page will be in a `<body>` tag. Text paragraphs are in `<p>` tags, while headings are within `<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc., depending on the heading level. `<img>` tags are used to include images, and `<a>` tags are used for links. `<div>` tags are a useful way to group other tags, for instance if your instructions consist of multiple headings and paragraphs, you can wrap them all in a `<div>`.

Anything between the special tags `<!--` and `-->` is a treated as a comment, and is ignored by the browser. Use these to leave yourself notes about what your code is supposed to do.

```html
<!-- This is a big heading -->
<h1>My Title</h1>
<!--
  ðŸ‘† Try to write more useful comments than this.
  Note that comments can span multiple lines.
-->
```

Most tags can contain either text, or more HTML tags. Some tags don't need to contain anything, such as `<img>`, or `<br>` (which creates a line break within a paragraph). As a shorthand, instead of writing `<br></br>`, you can write a single tag the closes itself, `<br/>`.

Tags can have *attributes*: additional information that serves a range of purposes. Attributes are defined inside the tag itself ðŸ‘‡

```html
<img id="my-image" class="big-image"
     alt="My image" src="images/file.png"
     something-else="foo" />

<p id="paragraph1" class="instructions">
    ...
</p>
```
In the code above, the `<img>` tag has its `id` attribute set to `'my-image'`, its `class` attribute to `'big-image'`, and so on, and similarly for the `<p>` tag. All elements can have `id` and `class` attributes. No two elements on your page can have the same `id`, because we'll use this to identify specific elements later. Multiple elements can have the same `class`, which lets us identify, style, and manipulate them together. Elements can also have more than one class. Other attributes are specific to different kinds of tag. `<img>` elements must have a `src` attribute, which indicates the location of the image you want to show (`alt` is the alternate text, which is used if the image doesn't load, or if the user is using a screen reader). Similarly, `<a>` (link) tags must have a `href` attribute, indicating where the link leads, e.g. `<a href="www.google.com">click for google.com</a>`. Finally, you can make up any additional attributes you like, such as `something-else="foo"` above. These will be ignored by the browser, but can be accessed using JavaScript.

## CSS

While HTML defines the contents of your page, CSS (*Cascading Style Sheets*) defines how they appear. CSS has a simple syntax.

```css
selector {
    propertyA: valueA;
    propertyB: valueB;
}
```

The `selector` is a command that *selects* certain elements on the page. You can select all tags of a particular type, for example all `<p>` tags, by using the tag name as the selector. Alternatively, you can select all tags with a particular `class` attribute (e.g. `'instructions'` with the selector `.instructions`), or select a specific element by its `id` (e.g. `#paragraph1`). More complicated selectors are also available, for instance `p .text` applies to all `<p>` tags that also have a class of `'text'`, while `p, a` applies to all `<p>` tags and to all `<a>` tags.

The `properties` and `values` are the CSS rules that you want to apply to the elements you've selected. You can find a full list of the available properties [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference), but we'll typically only need a few of these, such as `color`, `position`, and `width`, which we'll cover shortly. Finally, anything between `/*` and `*/` is a in CSS is a comment.

```css
/* Make all <p> tags blue */
p {
    color: blue;
}

/* Center align everything with class 'instructions' */
.instructions {
    text-align: center;
}

/* Change size of element with id 'feedback' */
#feedback {
    font-size: 24pt;
}

```

# Example: Flanker Experiment

Now, with the basics out of the way, let's start to put together an experiment. We'll use a simple version of the [*flanker* task](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eriksen_flanker_task) as our example here. We'll build up the experiment bit-by-bit, as you would when coding it from scratch. We'll start with a HTML page containing a few key elements, then write the CSS to make those  appear the way we need them to, in the right positions. We'll then add more elements, and more CSS, until we have everything we need.

## Bare Bones

Let's start simple, with just a fixation cross.


```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <!-- Everything above this line will be in every page we do -->
    </head>
    <body>
        <p id="fix">+</p>
    </body>
</html>
```

I've embedded the result below, but if you click the button below to open it in a new tab you can properly inspect it using the [Inspector Tool](../web-3/).

<a class="btn btn-primary" href="./examples/flanker1.html" target="_blank">Open in new tab</a>

<iframe src="./examples/flanker1.html" width="100%" height="200px"></iframe>


## Basic CSS

Next, let's add a `<link>` tab, which links to a CSS file, `style/flanker2.css`.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <link href="style/flanker2.css" rel="stylesheet"/>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p id="fix">+</p>
    </body>
</html>
```

We'll also have to create `style/flanker2.css`:

```css
#fix {
    position: absolute;
    left: 50vw;
    top: 50vh;
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
    margin: 0;
    font-size: 20pt;
}
```

<a class="btn btn-primary" href="./examples/flanker2.html" target="_blank">Open in new tab</a>

<iframe src="./examples/flanker2.html" width="100%" height="200px"></iframe>

We've done quite a lot here, so it's worth explaining the CSS line by line.
First, we've set the `position` property to `absolute`,
rather than the default value of `relative`.
This means that rather than placing the `#fix` element
below the elements that came before it (if there were any),
we're going to specify where exactly on the *window* we want it to be,
regardless of where everything else is.
We set `left` to `50vw`, and `top` to `50vh`,
meaning that the left edge is 50% of the way over from the left edge of the window,
and the top edge is 50% of the way down from the top of the window
(`vw` and `vh` stand for view width and view height; in other words, the top left corner is in the middle of the window).
We set `transform: translate(-50%, -50%)`, meaning
that we're translating (shifting) the element 50% of its width to the left on X-axis,
and 50% of its height up on the Y-axis
(or, in other words, that the middle of the element is where the top left corner
would have been, in the centre of the window).
This is quite complicated CSS to get started with, but this pattern
-- absolute position, `transform: translate(-50%, -50%)`,
setting the `left` and `top` properties --
is one we'll be using a lot to precisely control the position of stimuli in our experiment.
Finally, we set the `margin` to 0 (no padding around the text),
and set the `font-size` nice and big.

Before we go on, click the button above to open the page so far in a new tab,
open up the inspector in your browser, and see what happens when you
change or remove any of these CSS properties.

## More elements

Now let's add the most important elements of this task: the target and flankers.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <link href="style/flanker3.css" rel="stylesheet"/>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p id="fix">+</p>
        <div id="stimuli">
            <img class="flanker" alt="" src="stimuli/left.svg"/>
            <img class="flanker" alt="" src="stimuli/left.svg"/>
            <img class="target"  alt="" src="stimuli/right.svg"/>
            <img class="flanker" alt="" src="stimuli/left.svg"/>
            <img class="flanker" alt="" src="stimuli/left.svg"/>
        </div>
    </body>
</html>
```

To do this, we've added image tags,
showing either the file stored in `stimuli/left.svg` or `stimuli/right.svg`.
We've wrapped them all in a `<div>` with ID `#stimuli`, given the middle image the class `.target`, and the rest `.flanker`.

Here's the updated CSS.


```css
#fix, #stimuli {
    position: absolute;
    left: 50vw;
    top: 50vh;
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}

#fix {
    margin: 0;
    font-size: 20pt;

}

.target, .flanker {
    height: 10vh;
}
```

Since we want both the `#fix` and `#stimuli` elements to be located in the same place,
we've used a compound selector (`#fix, #stimuli`) to style both (we could also have done this by giving them the same class, i.e. `.centered`, and styling that).
You can no longer really see `#fix`, since it's under `#stimuli`,
but that's not a problem.
The second selector adds properties to `#fix` that we won't want to apply to `#stimuli`.
Finally, we use another compound selector, `.target, .flanker`,
to apply a rule to anything with either of these classes,
setting their height to be 10% of the height of the window.
Notice that since we haven't specified the `position` rule for the images,
they use `relative` positioning, meaning they're all side by side
rather than superimposed on top of each other.

<a class="btn btn-primary" href="./examples/flanker3.html" target="_blank">Open in new tab</a>

<iframe src="./examples/flanker3.html" width="100%" height="200px"></iframe>

## More!

Now let's add the rest of the elements we'll need.
The screen is going to start looking cluttered,
but that's OK for now.
At this point, I'm making some questionable design decisions,
because I'm going for a layout that's educational
rather than one that's ideal for this experiment.
Bear with me.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <link href="style/flanker4.css" rel="stylesheet"/>
    </head>
    <body>

        <p id="fix">+</p>
        <div id="stimuli">
            <img class="flanker" alt="" src="stimuli/left.svg"/>
            <img class="flanker" alt="" src="stimuli/left.svg"/>
            <img class="target"  alt="" src="stimuli/right.svg"/>
            <img class="flanker" alt="" src="stimuli/left.svg"/>
            <img class="flanker" alt="" src="stimuli/left.svg"/>
        </div>

        <div id="instructions">
            <h1>Flanker Task</h1>
            <p>Instructions go here</p>
            <button id="start-btn">Start</button>
        </div>

        <p id="scoreboard">
            Correct:   <span id="n-correct">0</span>
            <br/>
            Incorrect: <span id="n-incorrect">0</span>
        </p>
        <p id="feedback" class="green">Correct!</p>

    </body>
</html>
```

We've added three components: an `#instructions` `<div>` tag,
and `#scoreboard` and `#feedback` `<p>` tags. We're using the `<button>` tag for the first time in the instructions here, but it should be obvious what kind of element this produces. We've included `<span>` tags inside the scoreboard for each of the numbers.
These let us give IDs to spans of text within a paragraph,
and will be useful later when we want to update the text using JavaScript.

Our CSS file has more duplication than is necessary.
You can find a more concise version of this code in the GitHub repository
associated with these tutorials, which will be released with the next post.

```css
#fix, #stimuli, #instructions {
    position: absolute;
    left: 50vw;
    top: 50vh;
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}

#fix {
    margin: 0;
    font-size: 32pt;
}

.target, .flanker {
    height: 10vh;
}

#instructions{
    text-align: center;
    color: blue;
    font-family: times new roman;
    font-size: 16pt;
}

#scoreboard{
    text-align: center;
    position: absolute;
    left: 50vw;
    top: 0vh;
    transform: translate(-50%, 0%);
    font-size: 16pt;
}

#feedback{
    position: absolute;
    left: 50vw;
    top: 75vh;
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
    font-size: 32pt;
}

.green {
    color: green;
}
.red {
    color: red;
}
```

In the first definition, we've added `#instructions`
to our set of elements that should be centred.
We've also added another definition setting some unique properties for `#instructions`
(I've gone for blue text to make it visible over the stimuli, not because I think it looks good).
Similarly, we've added definitions for the `#scoreboard` and `#feedback` elements,
putting them where we want them.
Note the `transform: translate(-50%, 0%)` property for `#scoreboard`:
we've shifted it left by 50%, but not shifted up,
so that the top of the element,
rather than the middle of the element, is aligned with the top of the window. Finally, we've added the class `green` to our feedback element,
and added CSS rules so that everything with class `.green` is green
(and everything with class `.red` is red).
This will also be useful later when we want to change the colour of the feedback.


<a class="btn btn-primary" href="./examples/flanker4.html" target="_blank">Open in new tab</a>

<iframe src="./examples/flanker4.html" width="100%" height="500px"></iframe>

# Summing Up

At this point, we've created all the elements we need for the flanker task. In doing so, we've introduced most of the HTML elements we'll need for future experiments, and several of the key CSS properties, in particular those needed to position elements absolutely.  There are other useful elements and properties, but we'll cover these later as we encounter them in further example experiments.

The next step, in the next post, will be to use JavaScript (and [jQuery](http://jquery.com)) to make these elements dynamic. For this simple experiment, this mostly means showing and hiding each element as needed, changing the `src` attribute of the images to be either `stimuli/left.svg` or `stimuli/right.svg` as needed on each trial, and changing the feedback text and colour. We'll then look at how to handle inputs from participants (key presses on each trial, and clicks on the start button), before seeing how to put it all together into a fully operational experiment.

The next post will not be an introduction to JavaScript, because like HTML and CSS, there are already plenty of excellent JavaScript tutorials out there. If you're not already familiar with the language, I suggest reading through MDN'sÂ [JavaScript First Steps](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps)Â tutorials, in particular the first two: [What is JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_is_JavaScript)Â and [A first splash into JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/A_first_splash).
