This questionnaire is part of a project,
led by Mariana Babo-Rebelo,
looking at how the structure of real and virtual environments
influence how we experience them and what we remember.
It was first run at Tate Modern in 2019.

Participants spent some time looking around a virtual reality modern art gallery,
taking in the artworks.
They then completed this supercharged questionnaire on a tablet,
testing recognition memory for the paintings they saw,
aesthetic preferences,
and memory.
